System of springs and masses to model immersive boundary conditions

Compute the energy distribution in a system of masses and springs, 
and use them to model a wave propagating across the system.  
Then setup immersive boundary conditions in a few different ways 
and see how this effects the energy distribution.

The matlab code has more options and you can see an example of how to run it in SpringMassEnergy2.m
